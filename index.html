              Diem-Nhi Tran is a junior at the University of Texas at Dallas studying cognitive science with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Psychology/Human Computer Interaction. In plain English, she is a unique mix of computer science with brain science. She loves being a jack-of-all-trades in order to form a well-rounded perspective about the world of computing.

              At the moment she devotes most of her time to technology outreach by planning for Hack_UTD, her university’s first hackathon, as a part of her school’s Association for Computing Machinery chapter. It is slated to debut in January with aspirations to strengthen the student developer community at UTD. In the past, she’s helped with Microsoft’s International Women’s Hackathon, a crowdsourcing event meant to empower young women interested in computer science to participate in technological innovation.

              When she’s not talking up computing, she likes to do her own computing by tinkering with various programming projects. She is currently working on building this website as well as picking up Python in order to explore the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). She hopes to work on more projects related to natural language processing in the future, especially in the professional or research setting.
